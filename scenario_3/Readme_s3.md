- Allocating the first available seat to the passenger concurrently
- not all of them are allocated, outo f 120, only 6 or 4 are getting allocated
- why ?
    - classic case of contention 
    -  since all of them starting at the same time, all of them got the same seats
    - when both of them trying to apply, one value will be overwritten by the other
